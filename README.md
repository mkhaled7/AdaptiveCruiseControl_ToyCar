# AdaptiveCruiseControl_ToyCar

## Adaptive cruise control toy car built with Arduino Uno. Uses ultrasound to stop and go; itâ€™ll slow down and speed up in order to maintain a set distance from the car/object in front.
### USES PWM to control speed:
--> uses ultrasound to stop and go; it'll slow down and speed up in trying to maintain a set distance from the car infront 
--> there's a buzzer to warn for very close distance with an object  

Parts used:
Arduino Uno
Two 12V DC motors (240rpm)
L293 motor driver IC
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
Buzzer (active)
Three 9V batteries
