## AdaptiveCruiseControl_ToyCar

### Uses PWM to control speed:
--> uses ultrasound to stop and go; it will slow down and speed up in order to maintain a set distance from the car/object infront.

--> there's a buzzer to warn for very close distance with an object.  

#### Parts used: 
Arduino Uno,
Two 12V DC motors (240rpm),
L293 motor driver IC,
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor,
Buzzer (active),
Three 9V batteries
